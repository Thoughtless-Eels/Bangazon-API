The Thoughtless Eels

Overall Summary:
Working with the C# language and Asp.Net as our web application framework, the Thoughtless Eels are working to create a backend system that will allow other Developers the ability to add, search and at times delete the information from our company, Bangazon. These developers will have accesss to a myraid of tables from: Employeess, Training Programs, Computers, Products, Customers and these Customer's Active Orders. You will make your requests through PostMan and will check the Database (SQLite) for any new updates.
